The resort we were staying at A Lam organised for him to go to this hospital. He was quickly assessed with blood test and X-ray and diagnosed as having pneumonia. In a hospital bed within an hour. The doctor, Lai Quoc Thai, who is the head of the unit was exceptional. Highly competent and spoke excellent English. His team of nurses were really helpful too. What you need to know is a stay in hospital requires a carer to support the sick person so I stayed on a bed next to hubby. Reason being is the hospital doesn’t provide food or drinks. Opposite the hospital is a group of food providers which also give one somewhere to go. The hospital is very close to a very large shopping centre with a supermarket inside it. We are so grateful to the doctor and staff. We spent 5 nights there and flew back to Sydney with good information for our local doctor. Highly recommend this hospital. We also took a room at Spring hotel near hospital to do washing and for me to shower in only $27 a night and reasonable good. There are showers there but wanted a bit more privacy.

The nurse was so rude and not helping at all, my mom was having stomachache and backache so bad could barely walk but they didn’t allow me to get in to help my mom, and they didn’t help my mom as well. And every doctor knows that to get a better vision of an ultrasound, you should have drink more water before the ultrasound, they didn’t give my mom any water, she was freaking thirsty. My mom got medical history of kidney stones, and she been suffering from it for a long time ago, the stone is still in there but the doctor did the ultrasound said I see nothing here and the gel he put on her stomach, he didn’t give my mom anything to wipe it off until my mom asked for it, he just pointed “it’s over there”. Overal experience, I will never come back and if I have to come back, I just come to take the pictures and names of the 2 nurses that gave me bad experience.

Clean facilities, large rooms, and friendly staff, at least when they're dealing with pregnant women. My wife's single-bed postnatal room was worth every penny. The room (~30m2 or 320ft2) had a spacious bathroom, TV, closet, sofa, desk, large bed, and an AC. However, you should head over to VNVC for your child's vaccinations. The hospital regularly ran out of vaccines. We called the customer service line several times to inquire about the next shipment of vaccines or alternative locations but the girl on the line just snapped saying she doesn't know and hung up abruptly.

Bệnh viện đã tiếp nhận và sẽ cải thiện dịch vụ ngày một tốt hơn. Trân trọng.","4","I gave birth to my second baby in this hospital, both babies and the whole family were examined in this hospital. I'm very satisfied First of all, thank you for being cured when you came to the hospital. What I am most satisfied with is: The hospital is very clean, the space is quiet, giving birth or lying down is very comfortable. What some people find inconvenient is because they have to go to work so they don't have a caregiver or a replacement caregiver. As for me, I find it very safe, really very secure because this situation never happens. chaotic (selling lottery tickets, losing things, noisy...) like the hospitals I have visited Of course, everything has two sides, it's okay to limit the unnecessary sides, because in QT, people also have to understand that the cost must be high, because they also buy a service attitude. But recently, even when I went to see a doctor, especially when my child was in the hospital for 7 days, THU NGAN's attitude was very contemptuous, talking nonsense, every morning, noon and night, his face was as gloomy as a ghost, his attitude was irritable. What does it mean for someone to pay money? Even the RECEPTION lady on duty in the pediatrics department was the same. When she went to the patient's room and received her house card, the consultant couldn't hear what was going on in her mouth. If she asked again, she didn't have to ask, her face froze no matter what she asked, right? I asked back and forth 2-3 times, then I looked up and looked at me with some attitude I don't understand, like that kind of contempt?...a few more nurses, a few more nurses, more people to stay and take care of me and I have a problem. According to the hospital's REGULATIONS, the 2 people who directly take care of the baby will PAY DENTAL FEES. It's not FREE, but it seems like they're giving you permission? increase revenue for the hospital, why do we keep acting like the family has to beg and beg to give it? I haven't finished saying ""go back to bed, go home, I already know"" I haven't said it all yet. , when entering QTe, the attitude must be different, but it's the same everywhere, you have to know how to listen to understand, no matter how much experience you have, you still have to listen to what people say? need? What do you want?.... STAY AWAY, THA VISIT AND STAY HOSPITALIZED AT QUTE hospital, people accept the cost, ATTITUDE DECIDES MANY THINGS, the hospital should reconsider the way the hospital's medical staff interacts...k, I'm the only one who reflects about the negative attitudes of our hospital's YBS staff. I very much support my hospital's way of EXAMINATION_CARE_VISITING, but people who are sick or who are sick are already insecure. My attitude makes people feel more insecure, so who dares to come again.

Finished doing a bunch of urine tests, ultrasounds, two different types, then went into the room and groped a few times and called out to get the results! I'm so confused, I don't understand what a strange 4D ultrasound is, it doesn't matter at all! When I received the results, the lady said, is it time for a 4D ultrasound? Yes, sister! It's been too long 😼 go get an external ultrasound! Really, why didn't you say it at first? It was wasting everyone's time! People who go for an ultrasound mainly look at their baby's face, see how their baby looks, is it healthy, and that's what they do! What if there is no wish?

The hospital walkways between examination rooms do not have clear instructions, and there are no staff to assist. 2. The patient reported having sudden dizziness, fatigue, signs of high blood pressure... but was not taken to the emergency room but instead went to the waiting room to be examined. Luckily, what happens to the patient? If something happens to the patient, what will happen? 3. The doctor's examination seemed so superficial that I didn't know if I had been examined yet and also didn't know what was wrong with me?! 4. The cashier's attitude is not good. When the patient asked about the procedures, he was confused, frustrated and unable to help. Why, I wonder if this is the standard of an International hospital?! Hopefully the hospital will take note and work again to have a better service in the future, to match the hospital's ""International"" reputation. And we should add an evaluation section at the hospital so that customers can evaluate it right after the examination so that the hospital knows about their quality.

There are only 2 people, if you register more, you have to delete 1 of them (father or mother). The receptionist said that because he was afraid that a stranger would take the baby away, he registered under the counter and there was a big security guard sitting at the door. When he scanned the card, his face would appear, so why did he still say he could take the baby away? rigid and unacceptable. At around 7:15 on the second day, when I went down to register more people, I had to go back to the pediatrics department to let the nurse confirm again before I could go down to register. When I went down to register, the security guard informed me that it was time for administrative work and had to move to area A to register more people (dad had been removed from the care list). The pregnant security guard asked me to show you the announcement about the replacement time. During office hours, there is no notice board about this issue. Sitting and waiting for 30 minutes, no one registered. Meanwhile, I asked to register last night but was told to register later tomorrow morning. Now sitting and waiting, too rigid in the way it operates and handles. I'm very busy with work and can't be late because I have admin work at the company, but I still have to wait.

Bệnh viện sẽ cố gắng cải thiện chất lượng dịch vụ để phục vụ người bệnh ngày một tốt hơn.","4","The hospital is very clean and professional but still needs improvement. It must be said that the hospital is clean and professional from every step because it corresponds to the amount of money the patient spends. There is quite a lot of green space in the hospital, making patients feel somewhat comfortable. Prices are of course higher than public hospitals. Health insurance is applied but pays very little, most patients pay themselves. The lowest price for a room to stay if accompanied by a caregiver is about 450k (after deducting health insurance). The staff also gives quite thoughtful instructions. I had an ENT check-up and my teeth were still quite OK. The doctor listens and explains to the patient. Anyone who wants a quick examination can make an appointment through the hotline to have an examination schedule and arrange flexible hours. If examined in the afternoon, it is more comfortable, less sick and does not need to be booked in advance. The canteen is also quite full of food and drinks, spacious and airy. Prices are a bit higher than outside. Some suggestions: - It's quite inconvenient to have to wait a day to issue an invoice, and workers have to waste time going back to the hospital to get it when the road is reversed. - The emergency department security guard is a bit distracted and a bit sloppy (not trained according to international standards). - The parking lot is too far from the emergency department, so it is quite inconvenient, so a small space should be allowed to park motorbikes to provide first aid to patients.","18","956","Đan Ngô","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115677794928337705736?hl=en","115677794928337705736","246","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXeZECFzQuDFYgPNnWcvlzAuufGpFljIFPwwMdO6DWxRAhAXwqPAA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:02:25.7153+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

After a quick inspection, it's not as thorough as when it was new. Every time I go to the doctor to have my wisdom teeth removed, I have to have the right insurance but still have to pay 100%. When I asked, I was told that wisdom tooth extraction would not be covered by insurance. I told her my tooth was decayed and I would have it extracted. The receptionist said that other tooth cavities are covered, but wisdom tooth cavities are not covered. Extracting a tooth, including blood tests, x-rays and 2 examinations costs 2 million.

I tried to hold back and didn't understand what her intention was with the word ""value"", so maybe it was a mistake to bring van chuong out, I just wrote the truth here for you to consider when you come here! And everything Van Hue has its price! I don't know how much it costs to have ovarian cyst surgery, but here it costs 15 million.

Chính sách của bệnh viện là mỗi bệnh nhân đăng kí người nuôi bệnh để hỗ trợ chăm sóc. Và trước khi nhập viện đều được tư vấn cụ thể về việc thăm - nuôi bệnh. Trân trọng.","1","1. The hospital rules clearly state visiting hours, and parking hours are also listed on the notice board. But the staff did not allow them to visit the patient, reporting that there was only one patient taking care of the patient. When asked why the staff said something different from the notice board, they asked me to call the switchboard, but there was no answer. 2. The medical examination area has an instruction counter but no one is on duty there. Waited for a while before a staff member at the registration counter came over to answer the phone and ask a few questions.

Some people who don't have time to line up can call to make an appointment and can reserve the customer's number for a certain time. Every time a patient arrives on time for an appointment, they have to wait more than 30-45 minutes to be examined. Today, my mother had an appointment at 1:20 a.m. because she was busy with work, so it was nearly 1:27 a.m. when she arrived at the medical examination counter. The receptionist told her to arrive at 3:30 a.m. to be examined. So if I arrived at exactly 1:20 a.m., would my mother be able to be examined right away? International hospitals should learn from other hospitals about online scheduling. The security guard talks stupidly, you know, the receptionist always looks like he's at a funeral.

The hospital is airy and clean, the elevators are cleaned and cleaned many times in all lobby locations and patient rooms compared to other hospitals I have been to. I think it's very reasonable for the hospital to not allow visitors because it's quiet so the patient can rest and doesn't spread the disease from visitors to the baby. The staff, from the security guards to the nurses, are all very polite and knock on the door before entering. and support and clear explanations. The most important part is expertise. My family and I feel very secure when we see the doctors and nurses working skillfully and professionally. After the surgery, my wife's wound was painless and very beautiful.

Bệnh viện sẽ rà soát lại toàn bộ nội dung chị góp ý ở trên để cải tiến chất lượng dịch vụ ngày càng tốt hơn. Trân trọng cảm ơn.","1","Giving birth here until the birthday is 26 days (August 27, 2023), the total cost is 15 million, minus health insurance, it's 13 million. Having a second child meant everything was new. An acquaintance recommended that the hospital was clean and ok, so I decided to give birth here. Really disappointed! 1: The hospital is big but the canteen sells spring rolls in rotten meat. On Sundays the canteen is closed while the hospital only allows 1 person to be adopted and not allowed to visit, which is very inconvenient for pregnant women (not to mention the example Pregnant women from far away places come to give birth and eat at the canteen. On Sundays there is nothing to eat. When looking for food outside, there is almost nothing sold around the hospital). Second: the attitude of nurses and some doctors is so bad! Specifically, the doctor in the birthing area and the nurse in the postpartum room, I had low amniotic fluid so I had to induce labor and had to endure 12 hours of pain but still only dilated 2 inches in that area. At least 10 times the nurse checked to see if it was open. How many inches of pain were so excruciating that when he arched up, he was punched straight in the face?! The examination nurse was able to open 3 centimeters and moved it to the waiting room for delivery. When the doctor examined her, she said it was only 2 centimeters open and the pelvis was a bit narrow, so even if she had a normal birth, it would be very difficult, so she was thinking about a cesarean section. Because my amniotic fluid was dry and my pelvis was not open, I asked for surgery after hearing that, but another doctor angrily told me that if I wanted to do surgery, it would cost an additional 5 million. I didn't want to have surgery, so I was told that anything could happen. (so there were 2 doctors but each had 1 opinion), in the end I had to endure both labor and surgery pain. Tuesday: I was in room 2 (405 or 05). The toilet was extremely fishy and smelled of blood. The cleaners didn't scrub with soap but just sprayed water... I must say it was extremely fishy and dirty!

The first experience was a bit disappointing but not bad: - Waiting time for examination: few people but long wait. Maybe because many people who register in advance get priority. - Anyone going to the doctor for the first time should ask carefully where the clinic is. How long to sit and wait? When the number is not read, the elderly will be at a disadvantage because they wait forever and no one calls... - Waiting for the results/turning to read the results can take a long time. Some people wait from 8am to 11am to get a call. For me, it's 8am to 10am. A bit disappointing. - Regarding doctor quality/attitude, it probably depends on the department/doctor. I see some people are very enthusiastic. Some people have a disdainful attitude. Bad luck - The medical examination price is acceptable and not too expensive like the International name. - Facilities are ok, clean and not crowded. Because the hospital is international, many people are afraid of high fees and do not dare to come for a check-up. Including me once. - The staff working at the registration counter suddenly went nowhere for an hour and couldn't be seen. The order number keeps popping up and I don't see anyone and no one directs me to another counter. The process is a bit bad. It can be said that it is too bad compared to the name. - The clinic is one place but sitting and waiting in one place has nothing to do with being thousands of miles away. Give up. In this day and age, you still have to wait for the doctor to come to the door and read your name into the clinic, while other places have a status and a speaker that reads it automatically when it's your turn. I don't understand what kind of hospital is going to happen. In short: + Waiting time: 1* + PV attitude: 4* bad luck + Doctor quality: 4* good luck + Facilities: 4.5* + Price: Not too expensive (I don't know about the treatment). => The advice is that it is best to go to a state-level specialized hospital for serious illness treatment. Don't go to a private general hospital. Here, you should only go for medical examination and treatment for minor illnesses","8","956","Electrician - Làm mạch điện tử","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101184085798852405278?hl=en","101184085798852405278","6","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV0dpMbTily5aiWgYSrlG1cmPNuVjRG5ZjLEJATDahwXpB7F5oG=s120-c-rp-mo-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:02:47.428715+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

Although many people in my family have been treated at this hospital, including my parents, who come for monthly check-ups, I read so many negative comments that I was scared. Then whatever happens must happen. I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Nghia (surgical department) for the main surgery, the pre-anaesthesia doctor and the entire surgical team on June 7 for helping me go through the surgery smoothly. best ever. On this occasion, I would also like to thank Dr. Dang Thi Kim Anh (Department of Internal Medicine) for treating my mother for several years. My health is not good so all hospitals in BD province have my patient code. Currently, my family and I place our trust and health in the medical team of Becamex Hospital. Here, patients, in addition to receiving medical treatment, are also psychologically comfortable. Doctors, nurses listen, other administrative staff... are happy and polite. Proactively support and help patients. Good and clean facilities. Good price. Even though we know that when we have health problems, we can't help but feel worried and confused. However, please be a wise and intelligent patient and cooperate so that the doctor can have the best treatment method.","2","956","Moon Tô","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112703764151864343119?hl=en","112703764151864343119","18","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUPVBkjFcZXjYxqM9TxT-z5hMyq8Q3pdfBECVfxzNnL3fuKIjM=s120-c-rp-mo-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:02:51.680292+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

If you're sick, don't bring more pain in your stomach. Even if you stay in the hospital, you don't have to pay a penny. You don't have to beg, so it's difficult. Visiting the sick and taking care of them is better than being in prison, with all kinds of restrictions, rigid inadequacies, and when you go in you have to kowtow to the security guards, otherwise you don't even have to step into the hospital. When I was discharged from the hospital, I went to ask the staff about the paperwork and their attitude was better than the rest of the world. No matter how many public hospitals in Singapore I went to, I had never seen a place as bad as this place, with an international reputation.","7","956","Thuy Duong Tran","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112265160120536429341?hl=en","112265160120536429341","1","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLp7DG97UcoeEwccGwAGgTE_KfOlFra1BeskKGw39HAb-b-LA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:02:52.255925+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

The reception desk in the ultrasound room announced that patients were no longer accepted.

The next day I came back, and after a few rounds of traveling, I was able to get the sample. Come for your follow-up appointment. After hearing the doctor announce the results. I also left with peace of mind. When I got back to the car, I discovered that it was my name and my year of birth. The address, phone number, and biopsy sample date belong to someone else.

But I really didn't expect that instead of learning from experience and listening to customers' opinions to improve service quality, the hospital behaved like that. The hospital kept calling me to bother me, with the following content: : - The first person who calls and says they are a hospital will give me priority in sending me a health check-up form first so I don't have to wait to get it, but on the condition that I have to remove the review about the concierge's unpleasant attitude. guide here. And I did not agree because I wanted to see the hospital's improvement first. If it improves, I will remove it. But no, she turned around and said that if that was the case, we wouldn't send you a ballot to fill out first. - The second person was another person who called and said he was wrong in his assessment and did not acknowledge the staff's attitude like that. Then I asked again if he was there at that time. I know for sure that the staff did not have that attitude towards my people (our foreigners also complained about the staff's talking tone even though they I don't understand but the attitude is very unpleasant). This guy spoke even more harshly and said I was bad and asked me to delete the review, and I asked him not to call me to bother me about this issue anymore. But he still tries to call over and over again to bother me and talks like a parent. - The third person was the person when I came to receive the examination results that day. This person also had the same attitude and said that in the future the hospital would not let me be examined here again if I did not remove the review. And of course I have no need to return to a hospital where all the customer service staff here have such an attitude towards customers. I write this review hoping that the hospital's leadership will never cover up the staff's attitude as it will ruin the image of the hospital called INTERNATIONAL. It causes loss of sympathy for foreigners as well as Vietnamese patients who come for examination. IF YOU HAVE MIND, YOU WILL HAVE VISION.

I find this unreasonable, because I used the service for less than 2 days (ie less than 48 hours) but paid for 3 days. The doctor's attitude ""doesn't care"" about the patient: when my husband and I asked questions, they answered in an angry way. And yet, my wife really didn't have anything, in fact she misunderstood the signs of premature birth, but the doctor did not take the initiative to discharge her from the hospital early. I asked her to leave the hospital, but it was difficult to make it easier, no communication. Obviously, the procedures are cumbersome. To put it bluntly, the goal is to make the patient stay as long as possible, because the room fee for just one day is nearly 500K. Working in the Service (Medical) industry, you need to take the customer as the focus and understand the true needs of customers to provide the most complete service. If customers do not need to stay for medical examination and treatment but are forced to stay, the relationship between the Hospital and the Patient will actually soon end because of the lack of ATTITUDE FOR THE PATIENT. I will NEVER GO BACK TO USE THE SERVICES HERE AGAIN. Everyone should read the comments carefully before coming to this hospital!","15","956","Chieu Anh Nguyen Van","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113428590388694622473?hl=en","113428590388694622473","1","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWzvHqrVFNX6wohW1Ofz7uVSuYxVyUiXBwlY14BeZDJQTWzZw0=s120-c-rp-mo-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:03:00.002087+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

After that, my father had to have another urology check-up, but there was no one in the afternoon. Tomorrow, I called the appointment hotline 19002676 to ask for an appointment for my father. I tried to make an appointment in the afternoon but couldn't, so I wanted to ask for another day to schedule an appointment.

Cả hai bé đều được bác sĩ thăm khám và điều dưỡng chăm sóc vết thương ngay khi vào khoa Cấp cứu, lúc 11g50 mà chưa cần tạm ứng. Bé T.A.T có vết thương 2 cm ở bàn tay phải, đã được băng cầm máu, được chỉ định chụp X-quang để kiểm tra trước khi tiến hành khâu. Bé T.Đ.T có vết thương nông 0.5cm ở ngón cái chân phải, và vết thương nông 0.5cm ở đỉnh đầu, đã được băng vết thương, không cần khâu. Anh Nam (ba của bé) vào bệnh viện lúc 11g58, lúc này nhân viên hành chính hướng dẫn qua Thu ngân đóng tạm ứng 1 triệu đồng cho mỗi bé. Tuy nhiên anh Nam từ chối khâu nên đã thanh toán và ra về. Chi phí thanh toán bao gồm: phí khám cấp cứu, và thay băng vết thương (tổng cộng 310.000 mỗi bệnh nhân). Chi phí khám sơ cứu tại cấp cứu là giống nhau đối với tất cả bệnh nhân. Anh Nam phản ánh không chính xác với tình huống đã xảy ra. Chúng tôi không hoan nghênh các góp ý thiếu tính xây dựng.","1","Becamex Binh Duong Hospital has already lost money without doing anything. I advise people to go to big hospitals for examination, don't go to Becamex. Why should I take my two children to the emergency department and the doctor will bandage the wound and wait for family members to arrive? I paid 2 million in advance before stitching up my injured child. I was so upset that I told them what kind of big hospital it was, why didn't they save people first and let my child wait while my child was bleeding? Bandaging the wound, I was very frustrated. Waiting for me to pay an advance payment of 2 million before stitching it up. The hospital is weird. Saving people comes first. Waiting for enough money to get examined. I haven't been able to examine anything yet. I've spent two bandages on my child, but I'm so upset that I left with two children and two rolls of tape but suddenly I'm stuck at 620,000. What's with the hospital? It's like a robbery. So if you want to go to a hospital, find out about decent places or go to a big hospital. People don't go in. It's easy to get scammed and you can't do anything but waste money. In general, Becamex hospital should be shut down for not doing business properly.","4","956","Nam Tran","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117810505739857568927?hl=en","117810505739857568927","2","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIvxr4zYk3x7FjywIzQOhhK1lk4g-hoFyyDw7wsMFU5hIc4Aw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:03:10.078375+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

Anyone with a mild illness who wants to experience an international hospital at a good price should visit the hospital. As for specialized examinations, I still vote for the top level hospitals in the industry. Regarding inpatient treatment, please vote 2 stars. After being hospitalized for treatment, I have not seen any relief but feel tired due to environmental factors. When I asked for support, I promised support tomorrow... feeling dissatisfied and tired. Tired of being treated here. Regarding administrative procedures, the hospital should retrain the medical secretaries and nursing staff on how to interact with patients (customers). They feel that customer service is not good when they hear the words ""the doctor is here."" It's not like we can meet if we want to meet them, just wait."" At the same time, hospitals should reduce the discharge process ahead of schedule so that patients (customers) feel simple and save time. I hope the hospital will soon improve its medical expertise and customer care services so that I, as a customer, have the opportunity to return.","15","956","Ngọc Lê","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116629301627334336451?hl=en","116629301627334336451","4","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV_yRzblg67QujuwC9rZEL2UVUVE8BA2pc6tqcrpkcT79tK0GNk=s120-c-rp-mo-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:03:13.648404+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

When you come for examination, there will be specific instructions from the staff. However, you should book an appointment in advance to get faster. My wife went for a 4D ultrasound but it was her first time coming here so she didn't make an appointment so she waited for quite a while. It was just my turn to go in for the examination. When I went to see the doctor, I was told that the ultrasound schedule was full, so I had to make an appointment to come back in the afternoon. When I came back in the afternoon, I had to wait a long time for my turn. The doctors and nurses were enthusiastic and gave specific instructions. After 4d, there is a cd for you to watch again. Health insurance here accepts it but the payment is low, 4D ultrasound costs 440k but the insurance pays 20k so I have to pay 420k.

Foreigners who get a health check to get a work permit are 1.2 million/person. If they accidentally write a little edit, they will force the customer to write it down and charge an additional 50k even though the customer said there are 2 sheets so they don't need it. Edit the remaining sheet. When I went to get the results, I also had a concave attitude and spoke in a hard-to-hear manner. The customer came earlier than the prescribed time to deliver the results. Instead of telling the customer to gently wait and wait on time to receive the results, he spoke in a harsh, rude manner. .

Here is the most ""brainless"" way of operating I have ever encountered. We don't use notebooks here, it seems advanced but it's extremely incompetent :)). Everyone who comes has to wait to be registered. You can sit and wait or not, it's up to the security guard to see it or not :)) If someone just comes in, they're in, the person who comes in later gets priority first, to be searched or not is a ""right"". "" of the guard. To be honest, even if the management is divine, there are still mistakes. In this situation, there are about 100 people and there are exactly 2 people protecting the navigation, mistakes are inevitable, causing extreme frustration for customers. If you're unlucky, just sit all day. Sit for nearly an hour and still not be ""registered"" for examination :)). Exactly 1 hour and 20 minutes to register. Too happy:)) PS: If you have a mild illness and don't need to go for a lot of tests, you can go in the afternoon, it's very quiet :))","8","956","Ys Thang","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113513971802669873805?hl=en","113513971802669873805","4","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLB-OCJHZ33s9jMJ0VwMPqERAdnqId9onNi1ZJuh396iyTUfw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:03:21.670199+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

I had infected folliculitis of my big toe and had surgery at a clinic near my home. Because I didn't feel secure, the next day I went to Becamex International Hospital for a reexamination. Unexpectedly, when I went to see the surgeon, he didn't bother to open the incision to see if the condition was normal. I had to ask for a replacement bandage and call the emergency room. When you go to the emergency room, the cleaning staff cleans and then bandages for 175k in fee (the clinic charges 50k/time). The next day I returned to the clinic and the wound was opened and was seriously infected, requiring anesthetic injections and a lot of pus to be squeezed out. The clinic staff said there was pus behind the wound but the hospital didn't squeeze it out to clean it and let it get worse. From now on, I probably won't dare examine here again.","6","956","thương thanh","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113496746869299285235?hl=en","113496746869299285235","1","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKuS4Hd8plaTbed8pS_YqEyxpOKBN6LYhDJM5Wro-yGj_igbw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:03:28.341105+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

I went from 6am to 3pm and was exhausted. This time, the mail was sent to Becamex near my house. I saw on the website that it asked to make an appointment. If it was ok, I made an appointment, but the time ended early, only nearly 9 o'clock, so I thought it would probably be done at night. The switchboard called to come 30 minutes before, ok then come, the house told the province what to do. At 8:10 a.m., I lined up to register, and waited at 8:35 a.m. for a text message inviting me to come in for a check-up. I asked the doctor to do another blood test, which took more than an hour, took the mother to the cafeteria to eat and wait, and at 10:30 a text message came back to the clinic. The doctor showed me how to check the results on the phone. If she liked it, she opened it. It's so convenient that you don't need any documents. Went to buy medicine and arrived home at exactly 11 o'clock.","5","956","Nhật Tiếng","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103270796441177834268?hl=en","103270796441177834268","1","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKvVdNKQnQ_EsV35BMuaFeOmEpa9bxoOpEuE45bzUm8ufJskw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:03:33.534189+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

If I don't take half a step past the pharmacy counter, how can I hand it in at another counter, and the prescription is only 1 sheet? If you're a service provider, at least tell the patient to wait until they find out again. Isn't it better to talk about bullying as if they were asking for medicine from you? I spent money to buy insurance so I could go to the doctor and get medicine, but did I ask doctors like you for any money? Are your eyes exposed or what? Studying medicine, why don't you have any morals? Or just worry about learning how to diagnose and treat diseases and not learn how to be a human being?

However, compared to international standards, the staff's service is very limited. For example, the security guard Huynh Ngoc Binh at the medical registration counter even spoke loudly to customers (no one said. I knew the seat numbers were sequential so I sat in the wrong place. I thought I was sitting one row apart for Covid safety. and I still had my mother and her belongings for several nights in the hospital, so I sat in the row of seats adjacent to the back). When you know, please let me come and register for examination. For those who came later, I let them register first even though they didn't schedule online. While I sat for an hour, he didn't let me register. I am very dissatisfied with Mr. Binh's attitude. Because of rigid working and individuality. In addition, some nurses on duty have a disdainful attitude toward patients. I have been to many international hospitals, but Becamex's attitude is not up to standard, just like a public hospital. I think there's a lot to improve.","11","956","yen nhi vo","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117305406040198421248?hl=en","117305406040198421248","1","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocILt5oc94fNQaUU4UxHPlMFD5ofXar_8FDTuloaYgUkED8RVQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:03:39.03729+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

My mother was tired, achy, and had red pimples like a rash. She went in to see my mother. When I asked for blood to be tested to see what was wrong, the doctor refused and gave me a false diagnosis, 99% certain it was chickenpox. But my body did not have a single blister. After taking the medicine, he lay paralyzed in one place. Ng was walking around the hospital, took the medicine the doctor prescribed, then went back to lie down on the spot. So I wonder how the hospital does business? I thought my mother wouldn't survive. Luckily, she was taken to another hospital in time, not in critical condition. In the end, the doctor diagnosed that my mother was allergic to Becamex hospital's medicine. What happened? Becamex hospital? But doing business so poorly? While the illness is mild, the diagnosis becomes severe. Anyone who intends to go to the doctor should stay away from this hospital. Putting your trust in the wrong place is life-threatening. If the emergency department does business, sooner or later someone will die unjustly.","7","956","Hà Nguyễn","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104867363498719055360?hl=en","104867363498719055360","1","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWH-RxNswpApo1cAHfvl-wjBJ_WusPG03C7KtfK2wAGoTT2QYEWtg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:03:44.932689+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

As for treatment, it's frustrating for an internationally renowned hospital. Bringing in a 6 month old baby with a milk allergy, taking a vein and testing her arm would crush her. Anyone who gets an injection to draw blood but sticks it in but doesn't see any blood, then pulls out half the needle and then stabs it in another direction, stabbing it in 5 places like that and finally gets blood. Looking at it, I want to take my child home immediately. The staff is still unskilled.

When my child transferred from the hospital to 512, I went to the field hospital. When I tried to breastfeed my newborn, my last feeding lasted only half an hour. She said I went out to the car and didn't breastfeed the baby anymore.

My family and relatives recommended BV becamex bd as a very good hospital, so I chose to give birth here and started going for regular prenatal checkups from the 9th week to the 34th week. I don't choose to be born here anymore. The reason is that female obstetricians are really, really bad and don't care about their patients, working mainly just to get money, like a machine that can't talk, specifically as follows: I went to the doctor at 23 weeks and was prescribed a blood test, paying nearly 2 million to see if my baby had any genetic effects to fix it. I didn't save money and did all the tests. But when it was finished, the hospital gave me the results back without saying a word. I also didn't have the expertise to read the data symbols on it, so I thought there was no problem so they didn't say anything, because during the test. After that, they promised to return the results after 2 weeks. If there is any abnormality, they will call me as soon as possible to fix it. It wasn't until the 35th week that I had abdominal pain that threatened to give birth prematurely. At that time, I was in Saigon so I conveniently stopped by the clinic. When looking at my examination and test papers at Bec Binh Duong Hospital, the doctor circled the section. Do you know the data and say you have anemia? The doctor there didn't say anything? So I had to get my father's blood tested to see if the baby had a genetic condition so that I could fix it. Luckily, mine didn't have it. Even more angry was that at the 29th week, when I had an ultrasound at Becamex, I saw in the document that my baby had the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, but the female doctors here, when returning the results, didn't tell me anything and just gave me a bunch of information. The paper then made me sign and acknowledge that I had this examination and that. Now in the 37th and 38th week of pregnancy, I'm about to give birth, but my baby is very light, only 2kg5 due to iron deficiency due to anemia, so the baby can't conceive with the baby's umbilical cord wrapped around the neck, even though today I have gained up to 19kg. It's really sad when I go for a check-up at the internationally famous becamex hospital, but there are female doctors who don't care, don't advise me to have a healthy pregnancy, but instead spend a whole year examining women.

Staff attitudes are getting worse and worse. My baby had a fever of over 39 degrees on the 2nd day and was taken to the emergency room, waiting for a long time for the doctor. When he asked for the bed next to him, she said he was in the middle of nowhere and didn't see anyone asking. The doctor waited for a few people to take a look at it once. Don't bother measuring the temperature again. Say the two are the same. Right now I have a fever so I'm asking for fever-reducing medicine so I'll have to monitor for 2 more days and get tested. I know it's been 2 days since I've been sick, but it's been 3 or 4 days since I went to the hospital. But he has a fever of 39.40 degrees, so how can he leave it at home? Holding the baby in my arms, I was so confused. Before that, there was a time when the baby was at home at less than 39 degrees, then came to the hospital at more than 40 degrees and had to be admitted to this hospital. 2 days later, when I went to the doctor to get tested again, the baby had a serious infection and was admitted to the hospital. The hospital only had a nurse, and the hospital staff were only a little enthusiastic. The hardship of being admitted to this hospital is that only 1 person can be raised while the babies are so small. My baby is under 1 year old, he is sick and crying, in the middle of the night he holds the crying child with one hand and mixes fever-reducing medicine with the other. I don't know if you are thinking and giving instructions to a pet who is already in this situation. One day, the guard checked the sick care card three times to see if there were still people in the house. I felt like I was a prisoner being quarantined. The attitude is not friendly at all. I'm so sick of this hospital. Before I introduced it to many people, everyone who was sick always came here, spending money to exchange international labels for them to get a good one, they were even more disappointed. When I went to google and other information sites, I saw a lot of people giving bad feedback.","11","956","Manh Tran","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109792472929221522441?hl=en","109792472929221522441","1","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKui2udeqC1Dj7_g4BWvwo987plkC12LvtbxiStnhQPfhXr4g=s120-c-rp-mo-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:03:55.840563+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

In terms of getting a number, I agree that those who book in advance will have priority, (But priority should be given within the same time period to be reasonable) What's worth mentioning is that at 7:30, the security guard called the person who booked for 7:45 - 8:00 to line up, so those who arrived early but didn't make an appointment, have to wait after the person who booked later! Do you think it's reasonable? Not to mention, in the row of seats reserved for people who haven't booked an appointment, people who come later can also call ahead, because when I arrived, the security guard lined up in a vertical line, but when I called, they called in a horizontal line!

I asked the staff and they said they were having an ultrasound so I had to sit outside and wait for the numbers to come! I don't think anyone has an ultrasound. I contacted the doctor again when I saw that the ultrasound order number hadn't jumped up to 1 hour after nearly an hour, so the doctor hasn't been able to talk to me very gently lately!

When she was examined at 37.5 weeks, the pain from her old incision was so painful that she couldn't walk. She went to the doctor and said that some people had that pain but the surgery came out fine, yes. There was no pain but the old incision was still open. It was just a rupture. Then I was only given a small ultrasound. I didn't check the old incision. The doctor said if it hurts, lie down and don't go. It's a week before the surgery. Mekong ngta told me to do the surgery urgently to avoid the incision, thinking that pain would mean a higher risk, but the doctor talked like luck and bad luck, pain would have to wait a full week, the correct procedure was to come in for an ultrasound and measure the heart. Pregnancy, urine test, etc. As for the pain from the old incision, just ignore it, let the patient go home, and if the incision breaks, it's probably just bad luck.

It's a hospital. but internationally, the work is not professional, the attitude is too reasonable, I don't say the doctor's name because I still want to give them a chance.","8","956","Ngọc Lý","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110057454218681515739?hl=en","110057454218681515739","1","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVW16RLwlvECCsSRKY_MJPMGBG_XdvHEfh3YptjKYdbauT2po7O=s120-c-rp-mo-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:04:06.874705+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"

The day she went to Becamex, the doctor didn't examine anything, just asked a few questions. When I got the medicine back, my mother went back to the hospital where she usually examined her and was told to have a blood test done before giving her the medicine. My husband and I also had the same feeling when we went to the doctor twice for back pain and sinusitis, but I'm not an expert so I don't dare to say more.

There are 2 people in nursing on Sundays. There is a nurse who gives out medicine and smiles a lot, so he seems to be more popular with others. As for a person who takes care of hospital discharge papers, he probably cannot smile, nor look at the person in front of him when asked a question. From what he speaks, one can feel that his attitude is not polite and does not care about others. This is true. There's nothing wrong with their attitude standards. I've been a resident at Columbia Asia Hospital, Gia An 115 Hospital, or other public hospitals, and have never met anyone like that young nurse. Young people are what they should do.

If it could be improved, it would be great. - Regarding food, there is no food at the ward for patients like some other hospitals. It's a bit inconvenient because without family members, it is difficult for patients to buy food in the cafeteria. Food often runs out early in the lunch cafeteria. When I bought spring rolls in the morning, the dipping sauce was sour. If the patient couldn't distinguish the taste, if he ate it, he would get sick. Will the hospital be responsible? - The hospital is a public place, I agree, but the hospital should advise patients and family members about the rules and maintain general quiet. It is impossible to listen to chanting at 3:30 a.m. and listen to political news at 4:30 a.m. , other times the person making the video call loudly, filming all over the room. Even the sick person feels uncomfortable, let alone the sick person. We hope these comments will be considered and improved","0","956","Bảo Ly Nguyễn Kha","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101689337173267929716?hl=en","101689337173267929716","16","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX3pzF4v1w2yDzjLcrk0-ZW1hnBm-JvSU51kam0KB1R6FftA20=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100",,"0x0:0xabe0d94410baf545","2024-05-03 10:05:16.85922+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Becamex+International+Hospital/@10.9040943,106.5656015,12z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1zYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5n!3m8!1s0x3174d78fe8d9a42d:0xabe0d94410baf545!8m2!3d10.9040943!4d106.7097971!9m1!1b1!15sChti4buHbmggdmnhu4duIGLDrG5oIGTGsMahbmdaHSIbYuG7h25oIHZp4buHbiBiw6xuaCBkxrDGoW5nkgEIaG9zcGl0YWyaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUmxORGd5UW1oQlJSQULgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11fm7f7c8k?entry=ttu","most_relevant","English (United States)"
